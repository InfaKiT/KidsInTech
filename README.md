# KidsInTech

1. install from the pen drive - node, vs code, github desktop
   check install - "npm -v" "node -v"

2. Open Github Desktop and make an account
   Now you can see our codebase for today - https://github.com/InfaKiT/KidsInTech
   There are two branches;
       One called "development" - this is where we make and share changes (it's ok if some bugs slip in occasionally)
       One called "main" this is where we try to keep bug-free and update with the development code when we release a feature (this would go out to customers).

3. Go back to Github desktop and select "Clone a repository from the Internet" and use "https://github.com/InfaKiT/KidsInTech.git"

4. Put up your hand - your username has to be allowed to make changes to the repository - an instructor will add you.
